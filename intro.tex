\chapter{Introduction}

\epigraph{The SAT problem is evidently a killer app, because it is key to the solution of so many other problems.}
{Donald Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, section 7.2.2.2}

\section{What this is all about?}

\ac{SAT}/\ac{SMT} solvers can be viewed as solvers of huge systems of equations.
The difference is that \ac{SMT} solvers takes systems in arbitrary format,
while \ac{SAT} solvers are limited to boolean equations in \ac{CNF} form.

A lot of real world problems can be represented as problems of solving system of equations.

\section{Praise}

``Dennis Yurichev's "SAT/SMT by Example" is an impressive monograph. It provides an extensive and diverse collection of problems that
can be encoded as SAT or SMT problems, and discusses their encodings in detail. Its wealth of SMT examples in particular has made it
popular among researchers and practitioners interested in leveraging the power of SMT solvers.''
(Cesare Tinelli\footnote{\url{http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~tinelli/}}, one of CVC4's authors).

``This is quite instructive for students. I will point my students to this!'' (Armin Biere\footnote{\url{http://fmv.jku.at/biere/}}, one of Boolector's authors).

``An excellent source of well-worked through and motivating examples of using Z3's python interface.''
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki}}
(Nikolaj Bjorner, one of Z3's developers).

``Impressive collection of fun examples!''
(Pascal Fontaine\footnote{\url{https://members.loria.fr/PFontaine/}}, one of veriT solver's developers.)

``This is a great book. I've been recommending it to the students in my SMT class, as it's (by far) the largest compendium of constraint satisfaction problems/solutions that I'm aware of, including tons of unique and obscure ones. Good work, Dennis!''

Nikolaj Bjørner\footnote{\url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nbjorner/}}
and Mate Soos\footnote{\url{https://www.msoos.org/}} have also helped.

Masahiro Sakai\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/masahiro_sakai}} has helped with numberlink puzzle: \ref{numberlink}.

Chad Brewbaker, Evan Wallace, Ben Gardiner and Wojciech Niedbala fixed bugs and made improvements.

Alex ``clayrat'' Gryzlov, @mztropics on twitter and Jason Bucata found couple of bugs.

Xenia Galinskaya: for carefully planned periods of forced distraction from the work.

English grammar fixes: Priyanshu Jain.

\section{Disclaimer}

This collection is a non-academic reading for ``end-users'', i.e., programmers, etc.

The author of these lines is no expert in SAT/SMT, by any means.
This is not a book, rather a student's notes.
Take it with grain of salt...

Despite the fact there are many examples for Z3 SMT-solver,
the author of these lines is not affiliated with the Z3 team in any way...

\section{Python}

Majority of code in the book is written in Python.

\section{Latest versions}

Latest version is always available at \url{http://yurichev.com/writings/SAT_SMT_by_example.pdf}.

Russian version has been dropped -- it's too hard for me to maintain two versions. Sorry.

New parts are appearing here from time to time, see: \url{\GitHubBlobMasterURL/ChangeLog}.

\section{Proofreaders wanted!}

\section{The source code}

Some people find it inconvenient to copy\&paste source code from this PDF.
Everything is available on GitHub: \url{\GitHubURL}.

\section{Is it a hype? Yet another fad?}

Some people say, this is just another hype.
No, \ac{SAT} is old enough and fundamental to \ac{CS}.
The reason for increased interest to it is that computers got faster over the last couple of decades,
so there are attempts to solve old problems using \ac{SAT}/\ac{SMT}, which were inaccessible in past.

One significant step is GRASP SAT solver (1996)
\footnote{\url{https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~emc/15-820A/reading/grasp_iccad96.pdf}}, known as \ac{CDCL},
next is Chaff (2001)
\footnote{\url{http://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/publication/DAC2001v56.pdf}}.

In 1999, a new paper proposed using SAT instead of BDD for symbolic model checking:
Armin Biere, Alessandro Cimatti, Edmund Clarke, Yunshan Zhu -- Symbolic Model Checking without BDDs
\footnote{\url{http://fmv.jku.at/papers/BiereCimattiClarkeZhu-TACAS99.pdf}}.
See also: \url{http://fmv.jku.at/biere/talks/Biere-CAV18Award-talk.pdf}.

SMT-LIB mailing list was created in 2002
\footnote{\url{https://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/smt-lib/2002/}}.

Also, SAT/SMT are not special or unique.
There are adjacent area like ASP: Answer Set Programming.
CSP: Constraint Satisfaction Problems.
Also, Prolog programming language.
