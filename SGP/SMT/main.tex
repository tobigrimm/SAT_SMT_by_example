\section{Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem (SMT)}

\begin{framed}
\begin{quotation}
Fifteen young ladies in a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily so that no two shall walk twice abreast.

This is naive and straightforward solution:

\lstinputlisting[style=custompy]{\CURPATH/kirkman_MK85.py}

\begin{lstlisting}
group for each person:
person:A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O
day=0: 4 3 1 4 0 1 3 1 0 2 2 4 0 2 3
day=1: 2 4 0 0 4 1 2 3 1 4 0 3 3 2 1
day=2: 4 3 3 2 2 0 1 4 4 1 0 1 0 3 2
day=3: 0 4 3 4 2 0 3 1 4 0 2 2 3 1 1
day=4: 2 3 4 1 0 3 0 0 4 4 2 3 1 1 2
day=5: 0 4 0 2 0 2 2 4 1 3 4 1 3 1 3
day=6: 0 0 2 4 1 1 3 4 3 4 3 2 0 1 2

persons grouped:
day=0: EIM  CFH  JKN  BGO  ADL
day=1: CDK  FIO  AGN  HLM  BEJ
day=2: FKM  GJL  DEO  BCN  AHI
day=3: AFJ  HNO  EKL  CGM  BDI
day=4: EGH  DMN  AKO  BFL  CIJ
day=5: ACE  ILN  DFG  JMO  BHK
day=6: ABM  EFN  CLO  GIK  DHJ
\end{lstlisting}

It takes 3-5s seconds on my old Intel Xeon E3-1220 3.10GHz.
Thanks to picosat SAT solver, MK85 on this small problem has comparable efficiency as Z3's.

I've also tried to represent each number (group in which schoolgirl/golfer is) as a single bit (one-hot encoding):

\lstinputlisting[style=custompy]{\CURPATH/kirkman_MK85_onehot.py}

Unfortunately, bigger \ac{SGP} problems are out of reach. Yet?
