I want to group interesting ones, so the output will be: (a,b,c,d) (x,y,z)

What is the proper formal name for such an operation?
Join-intersecting-sets?
Gather-intersecting-sets?
Make-unions-out-of-intersecting-sets?

A delivery service company (like FedEx or UPS) uses 10 (decimal) digit tracking numbers.
Numbers are often transmitten by phone, scribbled on scraps of paper, etc.
You can add, say, 2-3 more (decimal) digits to add some redundancy, so the 10-digit code would be restored
if one digit was transmitten incorrectly.
How to do it?
