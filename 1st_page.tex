My dear readers! From time to time, I have questions, I don't know who (or where) to ask.
Or I'm just lazy...
Can you please help me?

What does tilde means in versions number in .dsc files, which describing Ubuntu packages?
Some kind of wildcard?
And what does \verb|>>| means?
Pipe is just \emph{OR}?
For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
Build-Depends: cython-dbg | python-pyrex, ca-certificates, debhelper (>> 8.1.0~), python (>= 2.6.6-3), python-all-dev (>= 2.6.6-3), python-all-dbg (>= 2.6.6-3), python-configobj (>= 4.7.2+ds-2), python-docutils, python-paramiko, python-pycurl-dbg, python-subunit, python-testtools (>= 0.9.5~)
\end{lstlisting}

I have a set of sets.

Some of them intersects with each other, some are not: (a,b,c) (b,c,d) (x,z) (z,y)

I want to group interesting ones, so the output will be: (a,b,c,d) (x,y,z)

What is the proper formal name for such an operation?

A delivery service company (like FedEx or UPS) uses 10 (decimal) digit tracking numbers.
Numbers are often transmitten by phone, scribbled on scraps of paper, etc.
You can add, say, 2-3 more (decimal) digits to add some redundancy, so the 10-digit code would be restored
if one digit was transmitten incorrectly.
How to do it?

Is there a formal name for such a graphs, that are somewhat similar to codeflow graphs?
They are also planar.
And has some kind of "nested" structure.
