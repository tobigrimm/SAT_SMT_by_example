\subsection{UNIX date/time}

UNIX date/time\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time}} is a number of seconds that have elapsed since 1-Jan-1970 00:00 UTC.
C/C++ gmtime() function is used to decode this value into human-readable date/time.

Here is a piece of code I've copypasted from some ancient version of Minix OS 
(\url{http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~cop4600/cgi-bin/lxr/http/source.cgi/lib/ansi/gmtime.c}) and reworked slightly:

\lstinputlisting[numbers=left]{KLEE/klee_time1.c}

Let's try it:

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
% clang -emit-llvm -c -g klee_time1.c
...

% klee klee_time1.bc
KLEE: output directory is "/home/klee/klee-out-107"
KLEE: WARNING: undefined reference to function: printf
KLEE: ERROR: /home/klee/klee_time1.c:86: external call with symbolic argument: printf
KLEE: NOTE: now ignoring this error at this location
KLEE: ERROR: /home/klee/klee_time1.c:83: ASSERTION FAIL: 0
KLEE: NOTE: now ignoring this error at this location

KLEE: done: total instructions = 101579
KLEE: done: completed paths = 1635
KLEE: done: generated tests = 2
\end{lstlisting}

Wow, assert() at line 83 has been triggered, why?
Let's see a value of UNIX time which triggers it:

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
% ls klee-last | grep err
test000001.exec.err
test000002.assert.err

% ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000002.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000002.ktest'
args       : ['klee_time1.bc']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: b'time'
object    0: size: 4
object    0: data: 978278400
\end{lstlisting}

Let's decode this value using UNIX date utility:

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
% date -u --date='@978278400'
Sun Dec 31 16:00:00 UTC 2000
\end{lstlisting}

After my investigation, I've found that \TT{month} variable can hold incorrect value of 12 (while 11 is maximal, for December), 
because LEAPYEAR() macro should receive year number as 2000, not as 100.
So I've introduced a bug during rewritting this function, and KLEE found it!

Just interesting, what would be if I'll replace switch() to array of strings, like it usually happens in concise C/C++ code?

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
	...

const char *_months[] =
{
	"January", "February", "March",
	"April", "May", "June",
	"July", "August", "September",
	"October", "November", "December"
};

	...

	while (dayno >= _ytab[LEAPYEAR(year)][month])
	{
		dayno -= _ytab[LEAPYEAR(year)][month];
		month++;
	}
	
	char *s=_months[month];

	printf ("%04d-%s-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d\n", YEAR0+year, s, dayno+1, hour, minutes, seconds);
	printf ("week day: %s\n", _days[wday]);	
	
	...

\end{lstlisting}

KLEE detects attempt to read beyond array boundaries:

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
% klee klee_time2.bc
KLEE: output directory is "/home/klee/klee-out-108"
KLEE: WARNING: undefined reference to function: printf
KLEE: ERROR: /home/klee/klee_time2.c:69: external call with symbolic argument: printf
KLEE: NOTE: now ignoring this error at this location
KLEE: ERROR: /home/klee/klee_time2.c:67: memory error: out of bound pointer
KLEE: NOTE: now ignoring this error at this location

KLEE: done: total instructions = 101716
KLEE: done: completed paths = 1635
KLEE: done: generated tests = 2
\end{lstlisting}

This is the same UNIX time value we've already seen:

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
% ls klee-last | grep err
test000001.exec.err
test000002.ptr.err

% ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000002.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000002.ktest'
args       : ['klee_time2.bc']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: b'time'
object    0: size: 4
object    0: data: 978278400
\end{lstlisting}

So, if this piece of code can be triggered on remote computer, with this input value (\textit{input of death}),
it's possible to crash the process (with some luck, though).\\
\\
OK, now I'm fixing a bug by moving year subtracting expression to line 43, and let's find, what UNIX time value corresponds to some fancy date
like 2022-February-2?

\lstinputlisting[numbers=left]{KLEE/klee_time3.c}

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
% clang -emit-llvm -c -g klee_time3.c
...

% klee klee_time3.bc
KLEE: output directory is "/home/klee/klee-out-109"
KLEE: WARNING: undefined reference to function: klee_assert
KLEE: WARNING ONCE: calling external: klee_assert(0)
KLEE: ERROR: /home/klee/klee_time3.c:47: failed external call: klee_assert
KLEE: NOTE: now ignoring this error at this location

KLEE: done: total instructions = 101087
KLEE: done: completed paths = 1635
KLEE: done: generated tests = 1635

% ls klee-last | grep err
test000587.external.err

% ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000587.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000587.ktest'
args       : ['klee_time3.bc']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: b'time'
object    0: size: 4
object    0: data: 1645488640

% date -u --date='@1645488640'
Tue Feb 22 00:10:40 UTC 2022
\end{lstlisting}

Success, but hours/minutes/seconds are seems random---they are random indeed, because, KLEE satisfied all constraints we've put, nothing else.
We didn't ask it to set hours/minutes/seconds to zeroes.

Let's add constraints to hours/minutes/seconds as well:

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
	...

	if (YEAR0+year==2022 && month==1 && dayno+1==22 && hour==22 && minutes==22 && seconds==22)
		klee_assert(0);
	
	...
\end{lstlisting}

Let's run it and check \dots

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
% ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000597.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000597.ktest'
args       : ['klee_time3.bc']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: b'time'
object    0: size: 4
object    0: data: 1645568542

% date -u --date='@1645568542'
Tue Feb 22 22:22:22 UTC 2022
\end{lstlisting}

Now that is precise.

Yes, of course, C/C++ libraries has function(s) to encode human-readable date into UNIX time value, but what we've got here is KLEE working
\textit{antipode} of decoding function, \textit{inverse function} in a way.
