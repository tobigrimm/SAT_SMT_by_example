\subsection{strtodx() from RetroBSD}

Just found this function in RetroBSD:
\url{https://github.com/RetroBSD/retrobsd/blob/master/src/libc/stdlib/strtod.c}.
It converts a string into floating point number for given radix.

\lstinputlisting[numbers=left]{KLEE/strtodx.c}
( \url{https://github.com/dennis714/SAT_SMT_article/blob/master/KLEE/strtodx.c} )

Interestinly, KLEE cannot handle floating-point arithmetic, but nevertheless, found something:

\begin{lstlisting}
...

KLEE: ERROR: /home/klee/klee_test.c:202: memory error: out of bound pointer

...

\$ ktest-tool klee-last/test003483.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test003483.ktest'
args       : ['klee_test.bc']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: b'buf'
object    0: size: 10
object    0: data: b'-.0E-66\x00\x00\x00'
\end{lstlisting}

As it seems, string ``-.0E-66'' makes out of bounds array access (read) at line 202.
While further investigation, I've found that powersOf10[] array is too short: 6th element (started at 0th) has been accessed.
And here we see part of array commented (line 79)!
Probably someone's mistake?
